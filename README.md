# doesxhaveyfromz
A simple website for cross-language comparison and learning. :thumbsup:

Say you're normally a Javascript developer, but you're working on a Golang project, and are learning as you go to accomplish a specific goal. You want to use functions from Javascript that you know and :heart:, but aren't sure if they have equivalents in Golang. 

Enter doesxhaveyfromz. Simply go to the website, enter Go for your X value, Javascript for your Z value, and (.trim() | .isNaN() | .escape() | etc...) for your Y value. If someone's answered, then see if their answer works for you. If nobody's ever asked it, submit the question. If you figure it out later on your own, come on back and answer it! :mortar_board:
